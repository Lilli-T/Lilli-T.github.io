    <h1>Experience</h1>
    <p>
      I'm currently on the teaching team for the class CSE 373: Data Structures and Algorithms.
      Head Teaching Assistant <br>
      Section Team Leader <br>
      Management Team Leader <br>
      Infrastructure Team <br>
      I've made teaching materials, led small classes, created feedback forms, and collaborated
      with wonderful staff to create an encouraging learning environment. I love seeing the many
      possible approaches to create a working solution. Designing data structures and algorithms
      is the best mix between mechanics and creativity.

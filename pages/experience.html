    <h1>Experience</h1>
    <p>
      My roles as a Data Structures and Algorithms teaching assistant;
      <ul>
        <li>Head Teaching Assistant</li>
        <li>Management Team Leader</li>
        <li>Infrastructure Team Leader</li>
        <li>Section Team Leader</li>
      </ul>
      I've made teaching materials, led small classes, created feedback forms, and collaborated
      with wonderful staff to create an encouraging learning environment. I love seeing the many
      possible approaches to create a working solution. Designing data structures and algorithms
      is the best mix between mechanics and creativity.

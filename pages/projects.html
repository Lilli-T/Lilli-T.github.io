        <h2>Campus Paths - Map GUI</h2>
        <!-- <video controls muted autoplay class="preview"><source src="../assets/samples/campus-paths-demo.mp4"></video> -->
        <p>
          This interactive map finds the shortest path between two buildings on UW campus,
          but it can easily be transformed to fit any locational data set. It uses a Java backend and
          a React front end. Reasoning through code, writing specifications, using invariants, and
          creating test cases were all exciting parts of the project.<br>

        <h2>T&P - Thrifting Site</h2>
        <!-- <video controls muted autoplay class="preview"><source src="../assets/samples/tandp-demo.mp4"></video> -->
        <p>
          We've taken some key features of popular thrifting and shopping sites and recreated them!
          I really enjoyed working with a partner on a web project.
          This site uses HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the front end, node.js, and a SQLite database.

        <h2>Flight App - Data Retrieval</h2>
        <p>
          What flights can take you from Seattle, WA to Boston, MA? This program, given a starting
          location and a destination, calculates both direct and indirect itineraries using SQL
          and produces them to users. I learned how to incorporate queries and transactions into
          backend code.

        <h2>Portfolio - Web Development</h2>
        <p>
          Making this site has been an adventure! I had a lot of fun learning about mixing JavaScript,
          HTML, and CSS elements in a project. I also learned about animating componenets,
          web deployment, and hosting services. Fun fact - my portfolio used to be built
          with React, and it looked like this! <br>

        <h2>Seam Carving - Image Program</h2>

        <p>
          I've both completed and taught this Data Structures and Algorithms project in Java.
          This project takes in an image and smaller dimensions, repeatedly finds horizontal and
          vertical pixel seams to take out, and writes that image to a file. This algorithm creates
          a graph and finds shortest paths using Dijkstra's algorithm and a priority queue,
          which I also implemented with a heap.<br>

        <h2>Mazes - Graph GUI</h2>
        <!-- <video controls muted autoplay class="preview"><source src="../assets/samples/mazes-demo.mp4"></video> -->
        <p>
          This Java program generates a maze using disjoint sets to execute Kruskal's algorithm,
          and it also solves the same maze using Dijkstra's algorithm. Users can also navigate
          the maze themselves. I found the flexibility and ubiquity of graphs fascinating.<br>

        <h2>Integrating Wildfire Protection - Data Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          Completed for a data science class, I worked with two other classmates to create this
          interactive page. We were curious about how the built environment affects human responses
          to wildfire smoke. Our final site is published using Shiny, and we also published a version
          using GitHub pages. We used R and markdown, and I enjoyed experimenting with different
          visualization types and interactive charts.<br>

        <h2>Incarceration Trends - Data Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          You can see my own work from a data science class in this project. This site is on
          GitHub pages, and I used R and markdown. I spent a lot of time learning different
          data wrangling techniques to find data trends. I spent additional time making the graph
          visually appealing.<br>
